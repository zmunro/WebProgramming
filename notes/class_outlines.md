# Tuesday, September 5th: Course Introduction
* Course wait-list
* Why (still) the web?  Why are you here?
* Motivation 1, the first web page (1992): http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
* Motivation 1A: http://line-mode.cern.ch/www/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
* Motivation 2: http://www.dolekemp96.org/
* Administrativa
* How two computers talk to each other: basic networking
* The Internet vs the World Wide Web

# Thursday, September 7th: HTTP
* PSA on sexual harassment
* Last class: the big ideas?
* Recall telephone conversation example
* Telephone extension numbers
* So what is the web?
* Two special computers: web server and web client
* URLs:
  `protocol://domain/<any directories here>/<filename>`
* The big idea of HTTP, how the web works: request-response, similar to Q&A
* Examining HTTP requests and responses on Reddit...
* HTTP commands: GET and POST
  - GET: Download data
  - POST: Upload data, send data to web server
* Demo: Web server
* Q: How to browse web without web browser?
  
# Tuesday, September 12th: HTML
* Last class: recall how HTTP works
* Recall question: if no port number is provided, the default port number to connect to on web server is...?
* Recall question: what HTTP command is executed when entering URL address?
* Recall question: if no file is provided in URL, the file with what name is generally served by default?
* To ponder: the best status code to use...?
* Take a look at the HTML
* What is markup?
  - The paragraph analogy
* Motivation: writing
* Block vs. inline elements
* Attributes
* Image --a special tag...
* Anchors
* Absolute vs relative URLs
* What's wrong with the HTML?
* W3C validator

# Thursday, September 14th: Revision Control with Git
* Last class: HTML => for the content, for document appearance and behavior, W3C validator
* Last class: Two major types of HTML body elements: block level and inline
* Recall question: difference between absolute and relative URLs --which to use for portability?
* Recall question: why is the `alt` attribute necessary for images?
* What I am NOT going to do: discuss every HTML tag
* What is important to discuss: the finer points of HTML
  - #fail
  - Recall last class: what's peculiar about HTML? (hints: closing tags, attributes, nesting)
  - Commandments
* Question: _how do you build a web browser?_
* What I've noticed in the past: many connecting to Tufts CS to do work via SSH, questions on submitting assignments and labs in this class, how to upload web pages to a server
* About file permissions and the HTTP response status code 403
* The nightmare scenario that illustrates the need for revision control: in the past...
* What if I need to hire developers to work on different pieces of a projet?
* Why revision control? Keep track of changes, document changes
* Why Git? Speed, no dependency of a remote server (unlike Subversion)
* Why GitHub for repositories? Network effect, communications
* Example with our course website
* IMPORTANT: you are not expected to master Git by the end of this course.  The reality, even for the most seasoned people: https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/707327952158121984
